               <p class="w">Adetola Daniel Oriade, <br>Hmmmm. My guy. I look back at your birthday last year and I am more than impressed at how far you have come. <br>If I start to talk, Omo! 
 
                If there’s one friendship I really really appreciate in the past years, No 🧢 bro, it’s this friendship of ours.<br>
                You’ve grown from a friend to someone I can call my brother.<br>
                Looking back at 2019 and the way you’ve grown, guy, you be bad guy! Ahn ahn!<br> 
                You challenge me a lot of times to always be better at what I do and how I see life and people. <br>
                Anyone and everyone will confidently say that you’re one very very ‘Unproblematic’ person and <br>
                I’m usually always stunned at the kind of person you are, cos everyone knows me as maybe opposite sha (not again🙂🙃).<br>
    
                Talking about tech career, Beast! I don’t know how you quickly grasp things that’ll take me and a whole lot of people a really long time to comprehend, <br>and you’ll just learn and starting using stuff like it’s a norm
    
                Make I no talk about Sch and the fact that you’re a brilliant dude cos that’s no news already.<br>I really really appreciate our friendship or brotherhood deni.
                And on this special day, I wish you the very very very very best in life. Cheers to more years brother!<br>
                This new year, no worry na, like I’ve always told you, we go flex ourselves well😊 and don’t forget you owe me a bottle🙂<br>
    
                Cheers brother!🥳🥂. <br>
    
                With love from Bukunmi (Bk)

                  Birthdays are special and so are you 
                  
                  You've been a fantastic friend and a brother in times of need 
                  I still recollect meeting Daniel in 2016 and ever since he’s been a constant figure in my life 
                  I also recollect all projects we've worked on together and how good you are not only as an electrical engineer but also as a badass software engineer (one of the best I've worked with)
                  
                  Thanks for your selfless acts, kind words and timely encouragement.
                  
                  On this special day, I wish you all the good things in life ..even much more than you can ever hope for 
                  Have a blast and enjoy your day<br> ~Jerry
