    The day you were brought forth<br>
    Was an awesome day indeed;<br>
    It allowed us to meet,<br>
    Which was just what I'd need.<br>
    <br>
    To share a life blessed with love,<br>
    Filled with joy and with suprises,<br>
    And be close to you, chulo.<br>
    <br>
    The day you were born<br>
    Deserves trumpets and drums,<br>
    Cymbals and hymns<br>
    For that day the sweet love<br>
    Of my life came along.<br>
    <br>
    It took years till we met,<br>
    But that day is the thing<br>
    That brought you to me,<br>
    And made my heart sing.<br>
<br>
    I pray this day brings much joy into your bossom<br>
    Joy, Laughter, peace and much memorable things along,<br>
    thank you for being you in your own way<br>
    Love you Ade ❤️
